# FlatsimDashboard
An interactive tool to explore Flatsim Sentinel-1 InSAR time-series

This interactive notebook allows for exploring an InSAR data cube generated by [ForM@Ter FLATSIM service](https://www.poleterresolide.fr/projets/en-cours/flatsim/). Please refer to [Thollard et al., 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/18/3734) for technical details of the FLATSIM service.

This tool relies on Python libraries [Holoviews](https://holoviews.org/) and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/).
